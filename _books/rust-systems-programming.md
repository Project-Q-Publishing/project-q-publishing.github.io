## About This Book

**Rust Systems Programming** is the comprehensive guide to building high-performance, memory-safe systems applications with Rust. Whether you're coming from C/C++ or new to systems programming entirely, this book will teach you how to leverage Rust's unique ownership system to build robust, efficient software.

### What You'll Learn

- **Rust Fundamentals**: Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes for systems programming
- **Memory Management**: Zero-cost abstractions and manual memory control
- **Concurrency**: Safe parallelism without data races
- **I/O and Networking**: Building efficient network applications
- **Operating System Interfaces**: Working with system calls and kernel interfaces
- **Embedded Programming**: Rust for resource-constrained environments
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling and optimizing Rust applications
- **Unsafe Rust**: When and how to use unsafe code responsibly

### Key Features

- **Hands-On Projects**: Build real systems applications throughout the book
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Compare Rust performance with C and C++
- **Cross-Platform Coverage**: Examples for Linux, Windows, and embedded targets
